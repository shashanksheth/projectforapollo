This folder contains the solution to Part 2 of the project.

The requested solutions can be found in the documents labeled "Part 2 Results - Daily.docx" and "Part 2 Results - Weekly.docx". 

In order to expose the code and enable interaction, I have shared a Jupyter Notebook file: BetaCalculation.ipynb. You can find documentation on how to engage with this file here: https://jupyter.org/install

Separately, I imagine this function being used as a code snippet in an existing codebase. Therefore, I have provided BetaCalculation.py for ease of use.
